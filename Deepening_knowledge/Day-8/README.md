## Working with Errors

Error handling in Go is an essential aspect of writing reliable and robust code. Go provides a simple yet powerful error handling mechanism that encourages explicit error checking. Understanding the basics and advanced concepts of error handling in Go is crucial for creating fault-tolerant applications. Let's delve into the details:

### Basic Error Handling in Go:

In Go, errors are represented by the built-in `error` interface, which has a single method, `Error() string`. Functions in Go commonly return an error as their last return value, and you can check if the function call resulted in an error using the following pattern:

```go
result, err := someFunction()
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error
}
```

### Custom Errors in Go:

You can create custom error types in Go by implementing the `error` interface for your own types. For example:

```go
type MyError struct {
    Msg string
}

func (e *MyError) Error() string {
    return e.Msg
}
```

### Advanced Error Handling in Go:

1. **Error Wrapping**:
   - Go supports error wrapping using the `errors` package and the `fmt.Errorf` function, allowing you to add context to errors and create a chain of errors.
   - The `errors.Wrap` and `errors.Wrapf` functions help to annotate errors with additional information.

2. **Error Types Assertion**:
   - Go allows you to use type assertion to inspect the underlying type of an error. This can be useful when working with custom error types.

3. **Error Handling Strategies**:
   - Go encourages handling errors explicitly at the point of occurrence to avoid unexpected behavior and silent failure.
   - Logging errors with appropriate context is a good practice to help with debugging and troubleshooting.

4. **Panic and Recover**:
   - Go provides the `panic` function for indicating that a program cannot continue. The `recover` function can be used to regain control of a panicking goroutine.

### Error Handling Best Practices:

- Always check errors explicitly.
- Handle errors at the appropriate level of the program.
- Provide enough context to understand the cause of the error.
- Use `defer` to handle cleanup tasks in case of errors.
