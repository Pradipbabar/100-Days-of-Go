## Day 6: [Deepening Knowledge of Functions and Packages](/Deepening_knowledge/Day-6/)

Task:

- Explore advanced function features such as variadic functions and closures.
- Learn about packages in Go and how to create, import, and use them.

Notes:

- Variadic functions allow an indefinite number of arguments.
- Closures are functions that reference variables from outside their body.
- Packages help organize Go code into reusable components and facilitate modularity.

## Day 7: [Pointers and Structs](/Deepening_knowledge/Day-7/)

Task:

- Understand pointers and their role in memory management in Go.
- Learn about structs, their usage, and how they relate to object-oriented programming concepts.

Notes:

- Pointers in Go point to the memory address of a value.
- They are used to share data across functions efficiently.
- Structs allow you to create your own data types by combining multiple fields.

## Day 8: [Working with Errors](/Deepening_knowledge/Day-8/)

Task:

- Learn about error handling in Go and the idiomatic way to handle errors.
- Understand how to create custom error types and use the `error` interface.

Notes:

- Go uses the built-in `error` interface for error handling.
- Use the `errors` package to create custom error types.
- Proper error handling is crucial for writing reliable and robust code.

## Day 9: [Understanding Interfaces](/Deepening_knowledge/Day-9/)

Task:

- Dive into interfaces and their role in achieving polymorphism in Go.
- Explore how to define and implement interfaces in Go.

Notes:

- Interfaces define behavior and are implemented implicitly.
- A type in Go implements an interface if it implements all the methods declared by the interface.
- Interfaces allow for writing highly adaptable and flexible code.

## Day 10: [Advanced Data Structures](/Deepening_knowledge/Day-10/)

Task:

- Learn about advanced data structures such as linked lists and queues in Go.
- Implement these data structures and understand their use cases.

Notes:

- Go supports linked lists and other data structures through the container/list package.
- Understand the advantages and trade-offs of using different data structures.
- Implement basic operations for these data structures to solidify your understanding.
