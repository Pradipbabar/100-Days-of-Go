## Advanced Data Structures


- **Linked Lists**: Linked lists are used when you need dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertion, and deletion of elements, and when the size of the data is not fixed. They are commonly used in implementing other data structures such as stacks and queues.

- **Queues**: Queues are used in scenarios where the order of processing elements is important, such as in task scheduling, breadth-first search, or handling requests in networking.

- **Arrays**: Arrays are a fundamental data structure in Go that allow you to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. They are useful for simple data storage and retrieval operations.

- **Slices**: Slices are a more powerful and flexible alternative to arrays in Go. They provide a dynamic view into arrays and support operations such as appending, slicing, and sorting. Slices are widely used in Go for handling collections of data.

- **Maps**: Maps are a key data structure in Go that provide an efficient way to store and retrieve key-value pairs. They enable you to associate keys with values and are commonly used for data lookup and storage operations.

- **Stacks**: Stacks are a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that allows for adding and removing elements only from the top of the stack. They are used in various algorithms and applications, including expression evaluation and backtracking algorithms.

- **Trees**: Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. They are used for representing hierarchical relationships and are the basis for more complex data structures like binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.

- **Heaps**: Heaps are complete binary trees that satisfy the heap property. They are commonly used for implementing priority queues, and they allow for efficient retrieval of the minimum or maximum element in the data structure.

- **Graphs**: Graphs are a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They are used to represent networks of interconnected objects and are fundamental in various fields such as computer networking, data processing, and social network analysis.
