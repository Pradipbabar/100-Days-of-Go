## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application.git
cd chat-application
```

### 2. Run Locally with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the chat application.

### 3. CI/CD with Jenkins

1. Create a Jenkins pipeline job.
2. Configure the pipeline to use the provided `Jenkinsfile` in the repository.
3. Set up Jenkins credentials for Docker Hub (used in the Jenkinsfile).

### 4. Deploy to Kubernetes

Ensure Minikube is running:

```bash
minikube start
```

Deploy to Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml -f kubernetes/service.yaml
```

Access the application using the Minikube IP and NodePort specified in the service.
