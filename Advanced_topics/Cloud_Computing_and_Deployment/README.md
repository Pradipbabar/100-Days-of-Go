# Cloud Computing and Deployment

## Deploying Go Applications on Cloud Platforms

1. ### Cloud Fundamentals

   - Understand the basics of cloud computing, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).
   - Familiarize yourself with the core services offered by cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

2. ### Go Application Deployment

   - Package your Go application as a deployable artifact.
   - Utilize cloud-specific services for deploying Go applications, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Azure App Service.

## Containerization with Docker

1. ### Docker Basics

   - Learn Docker fundamentals, including images, containers, and Dockerfile.
   - Containerize your Go application using Docker to create a portable environment.

2. ### Docker Compose

   - Use Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container applications.
   - Set up a Docker Compose file for orchestrating multiple services required by your Go application.

## Orchestration with Kubernetes

1. ### Kubernetes Basics

   - Understand the core concepts of Kubernetes, such as Pods, Services, Deployments, and ConfigMaps.
   - Install and set up a Kubernetes cluster on your chosen cloud platform.

2. ### Deploying Go Apps on Kubernetes

   - Containerize your Go application and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Define Kubernetes Deployment manifests for scaling and managing your application.

3. ### Scaling and Load Balancing

   - Explore Kubernetes features for scaling applications horizontally.
   - Set up load balancing for distributing traffic across multiple instances of your Go application.

4. ### Logging and Monitoring

   - Implement logging and monitoring for your Go application running on Kubernetes using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

1. ### CI/CD Pipelines

   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment of your Go application.
   - Utilize CI/CD services provided by cloud platforms or third-party tools.

2. ### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

   - Use infrastructure as code tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Google Cloud Deployment Manager) to define and manage your cloud resources.
