## Advanced Error Handling

Error handling in Go involves various techniques such as error wrapping, error chaining, and effective panic handling. Here's a comprehensive guide to deepen your understanding of these error handling techniques:

### 1. Error Wrapping:
- Utilize the `errors` package or third-party packages like `pkg/errors` to create wrapped errors that preserve error context.
- Implement custom error types that include additional information about the error's context and origin.
- Use the `fmt.Errorf` function to add context to errors and create meaningful error messages.

### 2. Error Chaining:
- Chain errors using the `errors.Unwrap` function to access the underlying error and extract relevant error information.
- Implement error chaining to propagate errors across different layers of your application, providing a complete view of the error path.
- Employ the `errors.Is` and `errors.As` functions to perform error comparisons and type assertions for error handling.

### 3. Panic Handling:
- Use the `panic` and `recover` functions to manage critical errors and gracefully handle panics in your application.
- Employ defer statements to capture panics and recover from them in critical sections of your code.
- Implement error checks and panic recovery mechanisms to ensure the stability and reliability of your application.
