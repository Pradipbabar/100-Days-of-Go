# Day 1-5: Getting Started with Go

## -

### Day 1: [Setting up Go Environment](/Getting_started/Day-1/)

Task:

- Download and install the Go programming language on your computer.
- Set up your workspace and environment variables.

Notes:

- Install Go version 1.16.7.
- Set the GOPATH and GOROOT environment variables.
- Verify the installation by running a simple "Hello, World!" program.

### Day 2: [Understanding Variables and Data Types](/Getting_started/Day-2/)

Task:

- Learn about variables and their declarations in Go.
- Understand various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

Notes:

- Variables in Go are statically typed.
- Basic data types include int, float64, string, and bool.
- Variables can be declared using the var keyword followed by the variable name and type.

### Day 3: [Control Structures in Go](/Getting_started/Day-3/)

Task:

- Study control structures like if, for, and switch statements in Go.
- Practice writing simple programs using these control structures.

Notes:

- Go uses curly braces for defining blocks of code within control structures.
- Use "if" for conditional statements, "for" for loops, and "switch" for multiple branching.

### Day 4: [Functions in Go](/Getting_started/Day-4/)

Task:

- Learn how to define and call functions in Go.
- Understand function parameters and return types.

Notes:

- Functions in Go are defined using the "func" keyword.
- They can have multiple parameters and return values.
- Functions can also return multiple values simultaneously.

### Day 5: [Arrays, Slices, and Maps](/Getting_started/Day-5/)

Task:

- Familiarize yourself with arrays, slices, and maps in Go.
- Understand their differences and common usage patterns.

Notes:

- Arrays in Go have a fixed size, while slices are dynamically sized.
- Use slices for more flexibility when working with collections of data.
- Maps are used for key-value pair data structures.
